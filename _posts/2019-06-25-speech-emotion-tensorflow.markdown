#Speech Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

Emotion recognition is the part of speech recognition which is gaining more popularity and need for it increases enormously. Although there are methods to recognize emotion using machine learning techniques, this project attempts to use deep learning and image classification method to recognize emotion and classify the emotion according to the speech signals. Various datasets are investigated and explored for training emotion recognition model are explained in this paper. Some of the issues on database, existing methodologies are addressed in the paper. Inception Net is used for emotion recognition with IEMOCAP datasets. Final accuracy of this emotion recognition model using Inception Net v3 Model is 35%(~).
